Part II - Implement Vendor Parser

1. Implement vendor.ProgramParser - use the src/main/scala directory. Use some example program files under the programs
    directory as test cases - the implementation should work for these files

    Implementation is in src/main/scala/vendor/ProgramParserConcrete

NB. I haven't yet deal with exceptions to the main instruction format which is is Vector[String, Int].
Not sure whether to do that now, or at part IV?


2. Modify factory.VirtualMachineFactory to return an instance of the implementation from the vendorParser method

This is very simple: just have to modify the code in VirtualMachineFactory to use ProgramParserConcrete as
its type of ProgramParser

Part III - Implement Bytecodes

3. Implement a bytecode for each of the defined bytecodes in the bc.ByteCodeValues trait (under bc.ByteCode trait)
    These should each be classes which extend the ByteCode trait.
