Part II - Implement Vendor Parser

1. Implement vendor.ProgramParser - use the src/main/scala directory. Use some example program files under the programs
    directory as test cases - the implementation should work for these files

    Implementation is in src/main/scala/vendor/ProgramParserConcrete

NB. I haven't yet deal with exceptions to the main instruction format which is is Vector[String, Int].
Not sure whether to do that now, or at part IV?


2. Modify factory.VirtualMachineFactory to return an instance of the implementation from the vendorParser method

This is very simple: just have to modify the code in VirtualMachineFactory to use ProgramParserConcrete as
its type of ProgramParser

Part III - Implement Bytecodes

3. Implement a bytecode for each of the defined bytecodes in the bc.ByteCodeValues trait (under bc.ByteCode trait)
    These should each be classes which extend the ByteCode trait.

 Fairly straightforward - note the pop() instruction in the (as yet unimplemented) VirtualMachine class is a tuple (int, vm)

4. Implement the bc.ByteCodeFactory that creates new bytecodes given a byte and arguments.
If you find it helpful you can override the toString method to print out the bytecode names to the console so you can
see if your code is working correctly.
